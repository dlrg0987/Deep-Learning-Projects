# Deep-Learning-Projects
Deep learning projects from Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization taught by Andrew Ng from deepgearning.ai


In the (5 - Neural Style Transfer project) folder which is one of the projects within main-folder titled 'Convolutional Neural Networks', the folder named 'pretrained-model' only contains a dummy file. To make sure that the jupyter notebook for the '5 - Neural Style Transfer project' works the following file instructions have to be followed: To obtain the pretrained model go to "https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style#requirements". Then scroll down to the heading "Requirements" on this github page and under "datafiles" you should fine the model called "Pre-trained VGG network". Once the project (5 - Neural Style Transfer project) is downloaded into your local computer, download the pre-trained model and place it in the folder: 5 - Neural Style Transfer/pretrained-model and rename it as "imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat".
